## Section B04 - Semantic Search: Deep Learning Meets Information Retrieval 

Mentor: Colin Jemmott

### What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting part about our domain is the exploration of the architecture and approaches of search engine. We get to assemble our own understanding 
and techniques into something that is usable in real life. 
### Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
I would like to investigate more on how to finetune the language models, parallel computing, and vector database. Basically how to deal with a runtime/memory demanding task.
### What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
In our quarter 1 project, we replicate a code search challenge using pretrained huggingface and microsoft BERT models. 
I felt like we spent too much time on exploring which model to use, and missed some other important component like how to fine-tune a model, learning-to-rank,
and how to use a vector-database or cloud computing platforms. Thus a potential change I'd make to our approach might be shifting the weight to these 
other task, deploying a more direct and simpler model and focusing on how to improve it.
### What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I am interested in building an interactable website for our search and receive actual user feedback, and tune our search engine accordingly. Namely, to experience a full cycle of the search.
